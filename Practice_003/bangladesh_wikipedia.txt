 Bangladesh,[a]officially thePeople's Republic of Bangladesh,[b]is a country inSouth Asia. It is theeighth-most populous countryin the world and among themost densely populatedwith a population of over 171 million within an area of 148,460 square kilometres (57,320 sq mi). Bangladesh shares land borders withIndiato the north, west, and east, andMyanmarto the southeast. It has a coastline along theBay of Bengalto its south and is separated fromBhutanandNepalby theSiliguri Corridor, and from China by theIndian stateofSikkimto its north.Dhaka, the capital andlargest city, is the nation's political, financial, and cultural centre.Chittagongis the second-largest city and the busiest port of the country. The territory of modern Bangladesh was a stronghold of manyBuddhistandHindu dynastiesin ancient history. Following theMuslim conquestin 1204, the region sawSultanateandMughalrule. During theMughalperiod, particularly under theBengal Subah, the region emerged as one of the most prosperous and commercially active parts of the empire, known for its thriving textile industry and agricultural productivity. TheBattle of Plasseyin 1757 marked the beginning of British colonial rule for the following two centuries. In the aftermath of thePartition of British Indiain 1947,East Bengalbecame the eastern and most populous wing of the newly formedDominion of Pakistanand was later renamed toEast Pakistan. Following over two decades of political repression andsystematic racismfrom theWest Pakistan-based government,East Pakistanexperienced acivil warin 1971; ultimately leading to awar for independence. TheMukti Bahini, withassistance from Indian forces, waged a successfularmed revolution; and at the expense ofa genocide, Bangladesh became asovereign nationon 16 December 1971. Post-Independence,Sheikh Mujibur Rahmanled the country until hisassassination in 1975. Presidency was later transferred toZiaur Rahman, who himself wasassassinatedin 1981. The 1980s was dominated by the dictatorship ofHussain Muhammad Ershad, who was overthrown in amass uprisingin 1990. Following the democratisation in 1991, the "Battle of theBegums" betweenKhaleda ZiaandSheikh Hasinadefined the country's politics for the next three decades. Hasina was overthrown in astudent–led mass uprisingin August 2024, and aninterim governmentled by Nobel laureateMuhammad Yunuswas formed. Bangladesh is aunitaryparliamentary republicbased on theWestminster system. It is amiddle powerwith thesecond-largest economyin South Asia. Bangladesh is home to thethird-largest Muslim populationin the world and thefifth-most spoken native language. It maintains thethird-largest militaryin South Asia and is the largest contributor to thepeacekeepingoperations of the United Nations. It consists ofeight divisions,64 districts, and495 sub-districts, and is home to thelargest mangrove forestin the world. However, Bangladesh has one of the largestrefugee populationsin the world and continues to face challenges such as endemiccorruption, lack ofhuman rights,political instability,overpopulation, and adverseeffects of climate change. It has twice chaired theClimate Vulnerable Forumand is a member ofBIMSTEC,SAARC,OICand theCommonwealth of Nations. The etymology ofBangladesh("Bengali country") can be traced to the early 20th century, when Bengali patriotic songs, such asAaji Bangladesher HridoybyRabindranath TagoreandNamo Namo Namo Bangladesh MomobyKazi Nazrul Islam, used the term in 1905 and 1932 respectively.[18]Starting in the 1950s, Bengali nationalists used the term in political rallies inEast Pakistan. The termBanglais a major name for both theBengalregion and theBengali language. The origins of the termBanglaare unclear, with theories pointing to aBronze Ageproto-Dravidiantribe,[19]and the Iron AgeVanga Kingdom.[20]The earliest known usage of the term is theNesari platein 805 AD. The termVangala Desais found in 11th-century South Indian records.[21][22]The term gained official status during theSultanate of Bengalin the 14th century.[23][24]Shamsuddin Ilyas Shahproclaimed himself as the first "Shahof Bangala" in 1342.[23]The wordBangālbecame the most common name for the region during the Islamic period.[25]16th-century historianAbu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarakmentions in hisAin-i-Akbarithat the addition of the suffix"al"came from the fact that the ancient rajahs of the land raised mounds of earth in lowlands at the foot of the hills which were called "al".[26]This is also mentioned inGhulam Husain Salim'sRiyaz-us-Salatin.[27] The Indo-Aryan suffixDeshis derived from the Sanskrit worddeśha, which means "land" or "country". Hence, the nameBangladeshmeans "Land of Bengal" or "Country of Bengal".[22] The first great indigenous empire to cover the territory was theMauryan Empire(ca. 320–180 B.C.). Following its decline, the kingdom ofSamatataarose, which was a tributary state of theGupta Empire(ca. 319-ca. 540 A.D.).Harsha(606–47 A.D.) drew Samatata into its loosely administered political structure. BuddhistPala Dynastyruled the region from A.D. 750 to 1150. It was overthrown by the HinduSena dynasty, which ruled the territory until theMuslim conquestsled byMuhammad Bakhtiyar Khaljiof theGhurid dynastyin 1204.[28] Bengal was then incorporated into theDelhi Sultanate(A.D. 1206–1526).[29]In 1341, the independentBengal Sultanatewas established byFakhruddin Mubarak Shah.[29]Amidst geographic expansion and economic prosperity, it was regarded by European and Chinese visitors as the "richest country to trade with".[30]: 10TheMughal Empireconquered Bengal in 1576.[29][31]By the 18th century, theBengal Subahemerged as the wealthiest province of the empire and was described as the "Paradise of Countries" and the "breadbasket of India".[29]Its citizens enjoyed some of the beststandards of livingin the world, as the region was a major global exporter and producer of cotton textiles (muslinin particular), silk andshipbuilding.[32]: 174Following the decline of the Mughal Empire in the early 1700s, the region became a semi-independent state under theNawabs of Bengal, founded byMurshid Quli Khanin 1717. In 1757, the state led bySiraj-ud-Daulahwas defeated by the BritishEast India Companyin theBattle of Plassey—which was key in establishing colonialBritish ruleover Bengal and the wider Indian subcontinent. Bengal played a crucial role in theIndustrial Revolutionat the expense of an extraordinarycapital flightand deindustrialisation following British colonial loot and the collapse of the Bengali textile industry.[33][32]: 7–10The catastrophicGreat Bengal famine of 1770caused over ten million deaths,[34]killing one-third of the total population of the Bengal Presidency,[35]: 47and remains one of thedeadliest man-made faminesin history. In the aftermath ofdirect British rulefor nearly two centuries, the borders of modern Bangladesh were established with thepartition of Bengalbetween India and Pakistan by theRadcliffe Line[36]during thepartition of Indiaon 15 August 1947, when the region becameEast Bengalas the eastern and most populous wing of the newly formedDominion of Pakistan—alongsideWest Pakistan.[37]The western and eastern wings of the newly formed Pakistan were geographically separated by a distance of over 1,000 miles, which became the root cause of deepeconomic inequality.[38]Khawaja Nazimuddin was East Bengal's firstchief ministerwithFrederick Chalmers Bourneits governor. TheAll Pakistan Awami Muslim Leaguewas formed in 1949. In 1950, theEast Bengal Legislative Assemblyenactedland reform, abolishing the Permanent Settlement and the zamindari system.[39]The Awami Muslim League was renamed as a more "secular"Awami Leaguein 1953.[40]The first constituent assembly was dissolved in 1954. TheUnited Frontcoalition swept aside the Muslim League in a landslide victory in the1954 East Bengali legislative election. The following year, East Bengal was renamedEast Pakistanas part of theOne Unitprogramme, and the province became a vital part of theSoutheast Asia Treaty Organization. Amidst rising cultural and societal differences—the brutal government crackdown on the 1952Bengali language movementto establishBengalias the official language of Pakistan spurredBengali nationalismandpro-democracymovements. Pakistan adopted a new constitution in 1956.[41]ThePakistan Armed Forcesimposedmartial lawin 1958, following acoup d'état, withAyub Khanestablishing a dictatorship for over a decade. A new constitution was introduced in 1962, replacing theparliamentary systemwith a presidential and gubernatorial system (based onelectoral collegeselection) known as "Basic Democracy".[42]In 1962, Dhaka became the seat of theNational Assembly of Pakistan, a move seen as appeasing increased Bengali nationalism.[43]In 1966, Awami League leaderSheikh Mujibur Rahmanannounced asix-point movementfor a federal parliamentary democracy. Ethnic, linguistic, and cultural discrimination was common in Pakistan's civil and military services, in which Bengalis were under-represented;[44]leading to East Pakistan forging a distinct political identity.[45]Authorities banned Bengali literature and music in the state media.[46]The Pakistani government practised extensiveeconomic discriminationagainst East Pakistan, including the refusal for foreign aid allocation.[47]Despite generating 70% of Pakistan's export revenue with jute and tea, East Pakistan received much less government spending. Notable economists from East Pakistan, includingRehman SobhanandNurul Islamdemanded a separate foreign exchange account for the eastern wing, also pointing to the existence of two different economies within Pakistan itself, dubbed the Two-Economies Theory.[48][49]The populist leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was arrested for treason in theAgartala Conspiracy Caseand was released during the1969 uprising in East Pakistanwhich resulted in Ayub Khan's resignation. GeneralYahya Khanassumed power, reintroducing martial law. Acyclonedevastated the coast of East Pakistan in 1970, killing an estimated 500,000 people,[50]and the central government was criticised for its poor response.[51]After the December 1970 elections, the Bengali-nationalist Awami League won 167 of 169 East Pakistani seats in the National Assembly. The League claimed the right to form a government and develop a new constitution but was strongly opposed by the Pakistani military and thePakistan Peoples Party(led byZulfikar Ali Bhutto). The7 March Speechof Mujib led to anon-cooperation movement. The autocratic Pakistani government then initiatedOperation Searchlighton 25 March 1971 in response.[52]Mujib signed theProclamation of Independenceon 26 March 1971, leading to the nine-month-long bloodyliberation war, which led toa genocide,[53]and the culmination of Bangladesh as a sovereign nation followingPakistani surrenderon 16 December 1971. TheConstitution of Bangladeshwas enacted on 4 November 1972.[54]Following independence, the Mujib-led government engaged in large-scale corruption and mismanagement, leading to nationwide lawlessness and economic devastation. Efforts to establishone-party socialismand alarge famine in 1974led toMujib's assassinationin 1975 following a significant decline in his popularity.[55][56]: 131The presidency was then transferred toZiaur Rahman, who re-established public order, industrialised agriculture, founded theBangladesh Nationalist Party(BNP) and initiated the creation of theSouth Asian Association for Regional Cooperation.[57]FollowingRahman's assassinationin 1981, the ensuing decade was amilitary dictatorshipunderHussain Muhammad Ershadthat saw infrastructural development,devolutionreforms, privatisation of nationalised industries and the declaration of Islam as thestate religionin 1988.[58][59][60][61] After the restoration ofparliamentary democracyin 1991, power alternated betweenKhaleda Ziaof the BNP andSheikh Hasinaof the Awami League, an era dubbed the "Battle of theBegums"—which defined Bangladesh's politics and history for next 34 years.[62][56]: 130The return of the Awami League to power following alandslide victoryin the2008 general election[63]underSheikh Hasina's leadership saw unprecedented economic progress alongsidedemocratic backsliding, increasing authoritarianism, endemiccorruption, and widespreadhuman rights abuses.[64]Hasina won her second, third and fourth consecutive terms in the2014,2018and the2024 general elections—all of which were shams and neitherfree nor fair.[65][66][67]Following astudent-led mass uprisingagainst the authoritarian government, Hasina wasforced to resign and fleeto India on 5 August 2024.[68]Aninterim governmentwas formed on 8 August 2024, with Nobel laureateMuhammad Yunusas theChief Adviser.[69] Since the 1980s, driven byfree marketpolicies andeconomic liberalisationmeasures, Bangladesh has achieved significant economic growth—emerging as one of thefastest-growing economies in the world, driven by its largetextile industry, which is the second-largest in the world.[70]It has emerged as thesecond-largest economy in South Asia, surpassing the nominal GDP per capita of neighbouring India.[71][72]Bangladesh has achieved remarkable feats in reducing itspoverty rate, which has gone down from 80% in 1971,[73]to 44.2% in 1991,[74]and all the way down to 18.7% in 2022.[75]ItsHuman Development Indexgrowth during the 21st century was surpassed only by China.[76]As part of thegreen transition, Bangladesh's industrial sector emerged as a leader in buildinggreen factories, with the country having the largest number of certified green factories in the world.[77]It has also given shelter toover a million Rohingya refugeesfleeing theRohingya genocidesince 2017, which has strained its resources and highlighted its humanitarian commitments.[78] Bangladesh is in South Asia on theBay of Bengal. It is surrounded almost entirely by neighbouring India, and shares a small border withMyanmarto its southeast, though it lies very close toNepal,Bhutan, and China. The country is divided into three regions. Most of the country is dominated by the fertileGanges Delta, the largest river delta in the world.[79]The northwest and central parts of the country are formed by theMadhupurand theBarindplateaus. The northeast and southeast are home toevergreenhill ranges. The Ganges delta is formed by the confluence of the Ganges (local namePadmaorPôdda),Brahmaputra(JamunaorJomuna), andMeghnarivers and their tributaries. The Ganges unites with the Jamuna (main channel of the Brahmaputra) and later joins the Meghna, finally flowing into the Bay of Bengal. Bangladesh is called the "Land of Rivers",[80]as it is home to over 57trans-boundary rivers, the most of any nation-state. Water issues are politically complicated since Bangladesh is downstream of India.[81] Bangladesh is predominantly rich fertile flat land. Most of it is less than 12 m (39 ft) above sea level, and it is estimated that about 10% of its land would be flooded if the sea level were to rise by 1 m (3.3 ft).[82]12% of the country is covered by hill systems. The country'shaorwetlands are of significance to global environmental science. Thehighest point in Bangladeshis theSaka Haphong, located near the border with Myanmar, with an elevation of 1,064 m (3,491 ft).[83]Previously, eitherKeokradongorTazing Dongwere considered the highest. In Bangladeshforest coveris around 14% of the total land area, equivalent to 1,883,400 hectares (ha) of forest in 2020, down from 1,920,330 hectares (ha) in 1990. In 2020, naturally regenerating forest covered 1,725,330 hectares (ha) and planted forest covered 158,070 hectares (ha). Of the naturally regenerating forest 0% was reported to beprimary forest(consisting of native tree species with no clearly visible indications of human activity) and around 33% of the forest area was found within protected areas. For the year 2015, 100% of the forest area was reported to be underpublic ownership.[84][85] Straddling theTropic of Cancer, Bangladesh's climate is tropical, with a mild winter from October to March and a hot, humid summer from March to June. The country has never recorded an air temperature below 0 °C (32 °F), with a record low of 1.1 °C (34.0 °F) in the northwest city ofDinajpuron 3 February 1905.[86]A warm and humidmonsoonseason lasts from June to October and supplies most of the country's rainfall. Natural calamities, such asfloods,tropical cyclones,tornadoes, andtidal boresoccur almost every year,[87]combined with the effects ofdeforestation,soil degradationanderosion. Thecyclonesof 1970 and 1991 were particularly devastating, thelatterkilling approximately 140,000 people.[88] In September 1998, Bangladesh saw themost severe floodingin modern history, after which two-thirds of the country went underwater, along with a death toll of 1,000.[89]As a result of various international and national level initiatives in disaster risk reduction, the human toll and economic damage from floods and cyclones have come down over the years.[90]The2007 South Asian floodsravaged areas across the country, leaving five million people displaced, with a death toll around 500.[91] Bangladesh is recognised to be one of the countries mostvulnerable to climate change.[92][93]Over the course of a century, 508 cyclones have affected the Bay of Bengal region, 17 per cent of which are believed to have made landfall in Bangladesh.[94]Natural hazardsthat come from increased rainfall, rising sea levels, and tropical cyclones are expected to increase as the climate changes, each seriously affecting agriculture, water and food security, human health, and shelter.[95]It is estimated that by 2050, a three-foot rise in sea levels will inundate some 20 per cent of the land and displace more than 30 million people.[96]To address thesea level risethreat in Bangladesh, theBangladesh Delta Plan 2100has been launched.[97][98] Bangladesh is located in theIndomalayan realm, and lies within four terrestrial ecoregions:Lower Gangetic Plains moist deciduous forests,Mizoram–Manipur–Kachin rain forests,Sundarbans freshwater swamp forests, andSundarbans mangroves.[99]Its ecology includes a long sea coastline, numerousrivers and tributaries, lakes,wetlands, evergreen forests, semi evergreen forests, hill forests, moistdeciduous forests, freshwater swamp forests and flat land with tall grass. The Bangladesh Plain is famous for its fertilealluvialsoil which supports extensive cultivation. The country is dominated by lush vegetation, with villages often buried in groves ofmango,jackfruit,bamboo,betel nut,coconut, anddate palm.[100]The country has up to 6000 species of plant life, including 5000 flowering plants.[101]Water bodies and wetland systems provide a habitat for many aquatic plants.Water liliesandlotusesgrow vividly during the monsoon season. The country has50 wildlife sanctuaries. Bangladesh is home to most of theSundarbans, the world's largestmangrove forest, covering an area of 6,000 square kilometres (2,300 sq mi) in the southwest littoral region. It is divided into three protected sanctuaries: theSouth,East, andWestzones. The forest is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The northeastern Sylhet region is home to haor wetlands, a unique ecosystem. It also includestropical and subtropical coniferous forests, afreshwater swamp forest, and mixed deciduous forests. The southeastern Chittagong region covers evergreen and semi-evergreen hilly jungles. Central Bangladesh includes the plainland Sal forest running along with the districts of Gazipur,Tangail, andMymensingh.St. Martin's Islandis the onlycoral reefin the country. Bangladesh has an abundance ofwildlifein its forests, marshes, woodlands, and hills.[100]The vast majority of animals dwell within a habitat of 150,000 square kilometres (58,000 sq mi).[102]TheBengal tiger,clouded leopard,saltwater crocodile,black pantherandfishing catare among the chief predators in the Sundarbans.[103]Northern and eastern Bangladesh is home to theAsian elephant,hoolock gibbon,Asian black bearandoriental pied hornbill.[104]Thechitaldeer are widely seen in southwestern woodlands. Other animals include theblack giant squirrel,capped langur,Bengal fox,sambar deer,jungle cat,king cobra,wild boar,mongooses,pangolins,pythonsandwater monitors. Bangladesh has one of the largest populations ofIrrawaddyandGanges dolphins.[105]The country has numerous species ofamphibians(53), reptiles (139),marine reptiles(19) andmarine mammals(5). It also has628 species of birds.[106] Several animals became extinct in Bangladesh during the last century, including the one-horned and two-hornedrhinocerosand commonpeafowl. The human population is concentrated in urban areas, limiting deforestation to a certain extent. Rapid urban growth has threatened natural habitats. The country has widespread environmental issues; pollution of theDhaleshwari Riverby the textile industry and shrimp cultivation in Chakaria Sundarbans have both been described by academics asecocides.[107][108]Although many areas are protected under law, some Bangladeshi wildlife is threatened by this growth. TheBangladesh Environment Conservation Actwas enacted in 1995. The government has designated several regions asEcologically Critical Areas, including wetlands, forests, and rivers. TheSundarbans tiger projectand the Bangladesh Bear Project are among the key initiatives to strengthen conservation.[104]It ratified the RioConvention on Biological Diversityon 3 May 1994.[109]As of 2014[update], the country was set to revise itsNational Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan.[109] Bangladesh, byconstitution, is aunitary state[110]and ade jurerepresentative democracywith aWestminster-styleparliamentary system[56]that hasuniversal suffrage.[111]Thegovernmentcan be divided into three pillars: the executive, the legislative and thejudiciary—all function to ensure accountability, transparency and checks and balances of the government.[110]Since its independence, theAwami League(AL) and theBangladesh Nationalist Party(BNP) have remained two of the most powerfulpolitical parties in Bangladesh.[56] Bangladesh is divided into eight administrative divisions,[121][83][122]each named after their respective divisional headquarters:Barisal(officiallyBarishal[123]),Chittagong(officiallyChattogram[123]),Dhaka,Khulna,Mymensingh,Rajshahi,Rangpur, andSylhet. Divisions are subdivided into districts (zila). There are 64 districts in Bangladesh, each further subdivided intoupazila(subdistricts) orthana. The area within each police station, except for those in metropolitan areas, is divided into severalunions, with each union consisting of multiple villages. In the metropolitan areas, police stations are divided into wards, further divided intomahallas. There are no elected officials at the divisional or district levels, and the administration is composed only of government officials. Direct elections are held in each union (or ward) for a chairperson and several members. In 1997, a parliamentary act was passed to reserve three seats (out of 12) in every union for female candidates.[124] Bangladesh is considered amiddle poweringlobal politics.[127]It plays an important role in the geopolitical affairs of theIndo-Pacific,[128]due to its strategic location between South and Southeast Asia.[129]Bangladesh joined theCommonwealth of Nationsin 1972 and the United Nations in 1974.[130][131]It relies on multilateral diplomacy on issues like climate change, nuclear non-proliferation, trade policy and non-traditional security issues.[132]Bangladesh pioneered the creation ofSAARC, which has been the preeminent forum for regional diplomacy among the countries of theIndian subcontinent.[133]It joined theOICin 1974,[134]and is a founding member of theDeveloping-8.[135]In recent years, Bangladesh has focused on promoting regional trade and transport links with support from theWorld Bank.[136]Dhaka hosts the headquarters ofBIMSTEC, an organisation that brings togethercountries dependent on the Bay of Bengal. Relationswith neighbouring Myanmar have been severely strained since 2016–2017, after over 700,000Rohingya refugeesillegally entered Bangladesh.[137]The parliament, government, and civil society of Bangladesh have been at the forefront ofinternational criticismagainst Myanmar for military operations against the Rohingya, and have demanded theirright of returntoArakan.[138][139] Bangladesh shares an importantbilateral and economic relationshipwith its largest neighbour India,[140]which is often strained bywater politicsof theGangesand theTeesta,[141][142][143]and theborder killings of Bangladeshi civilians.[144][145]Post-independent Bangladesh has continued to have a problematic relationship with Pakistan, mainly due to its denial of the 1971 Bangladesh genocide.[146]It maintains awarm relationshipwith China, which is its largest trading partner, and the largest arms supplier.[147]Japan is Bangladesh's largest economic aid provider, and the two maintain astrategic and economic partnership.[148]Political relations with Middle Eastern countries are robust.[149]Bangladesh receives 59% of its remittances from the Middle East,[150]despite poor working conditions affecting over four millionBangladeshi workers.[151]Bangladesh plays a major role inglobal climatediplomacy as a leader of theClimate Vulnerable Forum.[152] TheBangladesh Armed Forceshave inherited the institutional framework of theBritish militaryand theBritish Indian Army.[153]In 2024, the active personnel strength of theBangladesh Armed Forceswas around 230,000,[154]including the Air Force (21,000) and the Navy (27,000).[155]In addition to traditional defence roles, the military has supported civil authorities in disaster relief and provided internal security during periods of political unrest. For many years, Bangladesh has been the world's largest contributor toUN peacekeeping forces.[156]Themilitary budget of Bangladeshaccounts for 1.3% of GDP, amounting to US$4.3 billion in 2021.[157][158] TheBangladesh Navy, one of the largest in the Bay of Bengal, includes afleetof frigates, submarines, corvettes, and other vessels. TheBangladesh Air Forcehas asmall fleetof multi-role combat aircraft. Most of Bangladesh's military equipment comes from China.[159]In recent years, Bangladesh and India have increased joint military exercises, high-level visits of military leaders,counter-terrorismcooperation and intelligence sharing. Bangladesh is vital to ensuring stability and security innortheast India.[160][161] Bangladesh's strategic importance in the eastern subcontinent hinges on its proximity to China, its frontier with Burma, the separation of mainland and northeast India, and its maritime territory in the Bay of Bengal.[162]In 2002, Bangladesh and China signed a Defence Cooperation Agreement.[163]The United States has pursued negotiations with Bangladesh on aStatus of forces agreement, anAcquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreementand a General Security of Military Information Agreement.[164][165][166]In 2019, Bangladesh ratified the UNTreaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.[167] Since the colonial period, Bangladesh has had a prominentcivil society. There are various special interest groups, includingnon-governmental organisations, human rights organisations, professional associations,chambers of commerce, employers' associations, and trade unions.[168]TheNational Human Rights Commission of Bangladeshwas set up in 2007. Notable human rights organisations and initiatives include theCentre for Law and Mediation,Odhikar, theAlliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, theBangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association, theBangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Counciland theWar Crimes Fact Finding Committee. The world's largest international NGOBRACis based in Bangladesh. There have been concerns regarding the shrinking space for independent civil society in recent years.[169][170][171] Tortureis banned by theConstitution of Bangladesh,[173]but is rampantly used by Bangladesh's security forces. Bangladesh joined theConvention against Torturein 1998 and it enacted its first anti-torture law, theTorture and Custodial Death (Prevention) Act, in 2013. The first conviction under this law was announced in 2020.[174]Amnesty InternationalPrisoners of Consciencefrom Bangladesh have includedSaber Hossain ChowdhuryandShahidul Alam.[175][176]The widely criticisedDigital Security Actwas repealed and replaced by the Cyber Security Act in 2023.[177]The repeal was welcomed by theInternational Press Institute.[178] OnInternational Human Rights Dayin December 2021, theUnited States Department of the Treasuryannouncedsanctionson commanders of theRapid Action Battalionfor extrajudicial killings, torture, and other human rights abuses.[179]Freedom Househas criticised the government for human rights abuses, the crackdown on the opposition, mass media, and civil society through politicised enforcement.[180]Bangladesh is ranked "partly free" in Freedom House'sFreedom in the Worldreport,[181]but itspress freedomhas deteriorated from "free" to "not free" in recent years due to increasing pressure from the government.[182]According to the BritishEconomist Intelligence Unit, the country has ahybrid regime: the third of four rankings in itsDemocracy Index.[183]Bangladesh was ranked 96th among 163 countries in the 2022Global Peace Index.[184]According to National Human Rights Commission, 70% of alleged human-rights violations are committed by law-enforcement agencies.[185] LGBT rightsare frowned upon among social conservatives.[186]Homosexuality is affected bySection 377of thePenal Code of Bangladesh, which was originally enacted by the British colonial government.[187][188]The government only recognises thetransgenderandintersexcommunity known as theHijra.[189][190]According to the 2023 Global Slavery Index, an estimated 1.2 million people were enslaved in Bangladesh as of 2021[update], which is among the highest in the world.[191] Like many developing countries,institutional corruptionis an issue of concern for Bangladesh. Bangladesh was ranked 146th among 180 countries onTransparency International's 2018Corruption Perceptions Index.[192]Land administration was the sector with the most bribery in 2015,[193]followed by education,[194]police[195]and water supply.[196]TheAnti Corruption Commissionwas formed in 2004, and it was active during the2006–08 Bangladeshi political crisis, indicting many leading politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen forgraft.[197][198][199] Bangladesh'slower-middle incomemixed-market economyis among thefastest growing economiesin the world.[200][201]A rapidlydeveloping country, it has the world's36th-largest economyby nominal terms, and the24th-largestbyPPP. Bangladesh has alabour forceof 71.4 million,[202]which is the world'sseventh-largest; with an unemployment rate of 5.1% as of 2023[update].[203]Itsforeign exchange reserves, although depleting,[204]remain thesecond-highest in South Asia, after India.
