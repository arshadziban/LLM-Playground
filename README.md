# LLM-Playground

A personal playground for experimenting with **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.  
This repository contains my practice code, experiments, and implementations while exploring LLMs, embeddings, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and related NLP techniques.

Work in progress â€” constantly updated as I learn and build.
